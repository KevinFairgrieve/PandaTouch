# Cloud mode access code (2024/11/26)
Note that Bambu have recently implemented a 2FA cloud mode access code process even if the user has 2FA disabled. Updating to V1.0.6 will allow you to use your access code to log into cloud mode. After updating, please be sure to log out of cloud mode and then back in to ensure that it works correctly.
